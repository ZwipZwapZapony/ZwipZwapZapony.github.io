		<p>A video game "mod" is a "modification", changing or adding to the behaviour in the official release of a video game.</p>
		<p>I find enjoyment in mods, as they allow me to experience a favourite video game in a different way, when and if I feel like it.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>I primarily find myself modding four games recently, with quite a variety as to what types of mods I make depending on the game.</p>
		<p>- With DOOM (2016) and DOOM Eternal, I typically make various miscellaneous gameplay tweaks, changing small aspects of the games in a modular fashion.<br/>- With Minecraft: Java Edition, I mostly make personal resource packs, replacing the textures and models of a few blocks, items, and enemies.<br/>- With Sonic Robo Blast 2, I sometimes delve into the source code of the game, fixing small bugs or adding features in hopes of them being implemented in an official update of the game.</p>

		<p>You're probably here for the <a href="/DOOM2016Modding">DOOM 2016+ Modding</a> subpage, which relates to modding DOOM (2016) and DOOM Eternal.</p>
